JAKE,This job is eating me alive. I can't breathe anymore.
JAKE,"I spent all these years trying to be the good guy, the man in the white hat. I'm not becoming like them... I am them."
AMY,"What are you doing, weirdo?"
JAKE,I’m doing the best speech from “Donnie Brasco.” Actually-- --ten of me are doing the best speech from Donnie Brasco. Sup?
AMY,"Get it together, man. All ten of you."
AMY,Store was hit about two hours ago. Perps disabled the alarm
JAKE,Sorry! My bad.
AMY,"I’d like a list of your employees, anyone who had access to the store. I’d also like to apologize for my partner. His parents didn’t give him enough attention."
JAKE,DO YOU BELIEVE IN LIFE AFTER LOVE? --
AMY,"Dude, seriously?"
JAKE,"I know, not my first choice either, but it’s stuck. Got any other songs, Ahmed?"
AHMED,"No, is broken. You want it? One-fifty for you. Works perfect."
JAKE,"You literally just said it was broken. (singing) I THINK THIS ROBB-RY WAS A SMASH AND GRAB I REALLY BELIEVE IT WAS A SMASH AND GRAB, OH!!!"
AMY,"Really, Cher? I think it was an inside job. Prove me wrong."
JAKE,"A challenge? Is this a challenge? I love challenges! The door and the register were both forced, and they tripped a motion sensor -- i.e., not an inside job."
AMY,Or it’s an inside job meant to look like a smash and grab.
JAKE,"Sorry. We’re looking for three white males, one of whom has tatt sleeves on both arms."
AMY,"And how do you know that, dare I ask?"
JAKE,"I had a confidential informant on the inside. He spent years right here, in this sale bin, watching, learning, waiting. His code name is... (holds up teddy bear) Fuzzy Cuddle Bear! And he’s a nanny cam."
AMY,Ugh. You got lucky.
JAKE,"You know what they say: Luck is 95% talent, 5% being awesome."
AMY,No one’s ever said that.
JAKE,"(to the bear) Whelp... we did it, Fuzzy. We got ‘em. You can come home now. (as the bear) “I don’t know if I can. I’ve been undercover so long, I don’t even know who I am anymore. I’ve done terrible things.”"
AMY,All right.
JAKE,"(as Fuzzy, crying) “I strangled a Mr. Potato Head with my bare hands. Oh God, what have I become?!”"
TERRY,All right. Let’s get started.
TERRY,"Quiet, please. Come on, guys, I don’t want to have to raise my voice. Rosa?"
ROSA,Shut up! Everyone shuts up.
TERRY,"Thank you, Rosa. First off, Gina has some administrative announcements."
GINA,"Thank you. Thank you. No need to applaud. First of all, starting today there’s a new claim form for “lost equipment.” Sadly, I have misplaced it."
GINA,"But seriously, I do not know where I put those forms. If you see them, let me know. Also, my dance troupe, “Floor-gasm,” is performing at the Atlantic Antic on Sunday. Please come watch me dance, unless you are an old pervert."
TERRY,"Thank you, Gina. Open cases -- you closed the electronics store robbery from last week?"
JAKE,"Patrol picked up all three mopes yesterday, Sarge. Would you like to do the honor?"
AMY,I hate this. I hate this. Enjoy it while it lasts.
JAKE,I will!
TERRY,"JP, update on the Morgenthau murder?"
JAKE,"Early this morning, someone decided to shoot and kill luxury food importer Harry Morgenthau. Body was discovered by his cleaning lady. During her interview, using expert detective work, I deduced that she had something super gross on her chin. I took a picture of it, as evidence."
CHARLES,I think it was flan.
JAKE,Charles thinks it was flan. I think it was butterscotch pudding.
ROSA,"Maybe it was just, like, that old person gunk. You know the way they’re always covered in gunk? Oldies are gross."
TERRY,"How about we focus on the murder, instead of the old person gunk?"
AMY,"Crime techs are at the scene now, we’re heading back in a few minutes."
TERRY,I want the four of you on this -- it’s gonna be priority one for new C.O.
ROSA,"Tell us about this new captain. You worked with him before, right?"
TERRY,Years ago. Captain Holt will be here soon. He’ll want to introduce himself.
AMY,"Well, as soon as he’s settled in, I have a presentation for him. (pulls out folder) Crime-stat analysis for the precinct, and some strategy proposals."
JAKE,"Oh, are you hoping to be put in charge of the Brown Noser Squad, Sergeant Asskisser?"
CHARLES,"Yeah, then maybe one day you can be Lieutenant Asskisser, on the Brown Noser Squad."
JAKE,That’s exactly what I said.
CHARLES,"Great minds, right?"
TERRY,"Put the murder down, guys. Dismissed."
CHARLES,"Hey Gina, you know any scalpers? I want to buy tickets for the Rihanna concert for me and Rosa, but they’re sold out."
GINA,"...Okay, yeah, two points to make here. First: Rihanna? (gesturing vaguely to him) You... Rihanna. "
CHARLES,Yes. What’s your second point?
GINA,"That you’re wasting your time. She’s got a type, which is: anyone but you."
CHARLES,"Yeah, that was my ex-wife’s type, too."
GINA,"A Rihanna concert is a pretty big swing, man. She’s into watching old movies. Maybe start there."
CHARLES,Cool. Where... would I find a place that shows old movies?
GINA,Just go on the internet and search for the phrase “I want to buy two movie tickets for a girl who doesn’t like me.”
CHARLES,"...I don’t even need to add the zip code, or something?"
JAKE,Just got these crime scene photos -- look at the victim’s socks.
AMY,...What? I don’t see anything.
JAKE,"No, just -- they’re super nice socks, right? Where do you get socks like that? I have the worst socks."
AMY,Hey -- have you heard anything about the new captain?
JAKE,"No, and I don’t care. Terry runs the detective squad, and he’s great."
AMY,Terry’s an emotional wreck.
JAKE,"Yes, but he’s our emotional wreck. I wish Captain McGintly had never left. He was the best."
AMY,He was terrible. You just liked him because he let you do anything you wanted.
MCGINTLEY,What the hell are you doing?
JAKE,Fire extinguisher roller chair derby.
MCGINTLEY,...Okay.
ROSA,-- annnnnd go!
AMY,If I’m ever gonna make captain I need a good mentor. I need my rabbi.
JAKE,"Sorry, dude. This new guy’s gonna be a washed-up pencil pusher, who’s forgotten how to be a cop, and is only concerned with -- -- following every rule in the Patrol Guide, meep morp robot captain engage."
HOLT,Is that what you think?
JAKE,Hey! You must be the new C.O. Detective Jake Peralta. Great to meet you.
HOLT,Don’t let me interrupt. You were describing what kind of person I’m going to be. I’d like you to finish. 
JAKE,"Well, lemme see... ”washed-up pencil- pusher”... ”forgotten how to be a cop”... I think I was done, actually."
HOLT,Okay. Now do the robot voice. The robot voice you were doing when you implied I’m a rule-following robot. I want to hear it again.
JAKE,...“Meep morp... zeep... robot...”
HOLT,"That’s a terrible robot voice. And the next time I see you, I’d like you to be wearing a necktie."
JAKE,Our old captain didn’t care if we wore ties.
HOLT,"Well, your new captain does. And more importantly, he cares that you follow his direct orders. Everyone. I’m your new commanding officer, Captain Ray Holt."
AMY,Speech! Speech!
HOLT,"That was my speech. Sergeant Jeffords, a word?"
AMY,I love that guy.
GINA,"Yeah, he’s really suave. Anyone else get kind of a gay vibe?"
HOLT,Sergeant. You were in the 18th with me. Though you were significantly...
TERRY,"Fatter, sir. They called me Terry Titties. Because I had... large..."
HOLT,"Titties. Yes. I remember. I never liked that nickname. Though to be fair, it was accurate. Says here you’re on administrative leave?"
TERRY,"A year ago, my wife and I had twin baby girls. Cagney and Lacey. Ever since, I’ve kind of... clenched up. Lost my edge. There was an incident."
TERRY,You go in first. I’m feeling jumpy.
JAKE,What? You always go in first. Look at you -- those biceps don’t go in “second.” 
JAKE,I think he’s dead.
TERRY,"It’s been a year, and I... haven’t..."
HOLT,Tell me about your detective squad.
TERRY,"Scully, Hitchcock, and Daniels. They’re pretty much worthless. But they make good coffee."
HOLT,Copy that.
TERRY,"Now the good ones. Rosa Diaz: tough, smart, hard to read, and scary as hell."
ROSA,Tell me who has me for Secret Santa.
HITCHCOCK,No! That takes all the fun out of it.
HITCHCOCK,It’s Scully. He got you a scarf. It’s blue and ugly. I’ll make him return it.
TERRY,"Charles Boyle: he’s a grinder. Not the most brilliant detective, but he works harder than anyone else. He’s not physically... gifted."
CHARLES,Awww man! My muffin!
CHARLES,Ow! My head! My muffin and my head!
TERRY,"Amy Santiago: first girl cop in a family of cops. Gets underestimated because of her looks, so she’s always trying to prove she’s tough."
AMY,You think I can’t handle this much hot sauce? I can handle way more than this.
AMY,In... your... face.
SCULLY,...I didn’t say anything.
TERRY,"She and Peralta have some big bet over who gets more arrests this year. At first I objected, but ever since the bet, their numbers have gone way up."
HOLT,Tell me about Peralta.
TERRY,Jacob Peralta is my best detective -- he likes putting away bad guys and he loves solving puzzles. The only puzzle he hasn’t solved... is how to grow up.
HOLT,That’s very well put.
TERRY,I’ve talked a lot about Jake in my departmentally-mandated therapy sessions.
HOLT,"They finally gave me my shot, Terry. You know my history -- you know how important this is to me. This precinct is doing fine. But I want to make it the best in Brooklyn. And I need your help."
TERRY,"Absolutely, sir. Where do we start?"
HOLT,We start with him.
JAKE,"Okay. Perp came in through the window, left that muddy footprint, broke that cabinet -- hold on, hold on. Is everyone wearing a necktie? Because it’s impossible to solve crimes if you’re not wearing a tie."
AMY,Shell casings found here. ...Two shots. Bang... bang.
JAKE,"I concur. Good work, detective. You get a tie."
CHARLES,That’s mine. You took it out of my desk.
JAKE,"That’s right, Boyle. Good solve."
CHARLES,Thanks!
AMY,Shut up about Holt -- that man is going to be my rabbi.
JAKE,"First of all, it’s very weird to hear a Cuban woman refer to an African American man as her rabbi. Secondly, your “rabbi’s” a pain in my ass."
CHARLES,"Yeah, he’s a little too serious. What do you think, Rosa?"
ROSA,Seems cool.
CHARLES,"Yeah, seems cool, I agree."
ROSA,"Looks like the perp stole: a computer, a watch, and a jamon iberico ham, valued at... what?! Six thousand bucks?"
JAKE,A ham for $6000? Is it from a talking pig? Is it made out of “Babe: Pig in the City?”
CHARLES,"Jamon iberico is an amazing cured ham from Spain. They had it at my uncle’s funeral. I gorged myself at that funeral. I was constipated for three days. Rest in peace, Uncle Johnny."
JAKE,A murder and a ham heist? Things just got interesting. This is Captain Ray Holt. We’re gonna need some extra ties.
HOLT,"Speaking of ties, where’s yours, Meep-Morp?"
JAKE,You gotta be kidding me. Hi Captain! What are you doing here?
HOLT,I like to know what my detectives are up to. Take Santiago and knock on doors -- see if the neighbors heard anything.
JAKE,Door duty? It’s a waste of time.
HOLT,Diaz and Boyle check in with the coroner. Report back to me in an hour.
JAKE,I think he’s starting to like me!
HOLT,"No, I’m not."
CHARLES,"Hey, Rosa. I just happened to notice, there’s an old movie festival at the Film Forum this week. You want to go?"
ROSA,Sure.
CHARLES,"Cool! Awesome. There’s a bunch of movie options, so I’ll send you those options, and you can pick an option and we will watch that option."
ROSA,You just pick.
CHARLES,Yeah. I can definitely do that. I’ll probably just go with something classic? Like “Citizen Kane.”
ROSA,“Citizen Kane” is terrible. Pick a good movie.
CHARLES,It’s every critic’s favorite movie.
JAKE,Let the wasting of time begin.
AMY,"As my grandpa used to say, “You gotta smell a lot of feet before you find the six-toed prince.”"
JAKE,What?
AMY,Cuba’s a weird place. It means: “you gotta put in the work if you want the reward.”
JAKE,The reward is a six-toed prince?!
AMY,"Hello, sir -- can we ask you a few questions?"
BUNDER,"Definitely. I’m actually super glad you guys are here. Are you smelling that weed smell? A dude just broke in here, smoked weed, and bolted."
JAKE,"Yeah, that checks out."
AMY,What is your name?
BRJKOL,My name Brjkolj. B-R-J-K-O-L-J.
JAKE,"So, just like it sounds."
AMY,Have you ever seen this man before? He was shot last night.
BRJKOL,Thank you. Brjkolj like.
AMY,...Sir? That’s ours. We need that. And he kept it.
JAKE,Has anyone in the history of police work ever solved a crime by doing door duty?
AMY,"First of all, yes. Many, many times. Secondly, my dad met my mom doing door duty in Queens."
JAKE,"Well, I doubt you’re going to meet thefuture Mr. Santiago in this hallway."
AMY,"I don’t know. Wall Street Journal on the doormat, corner apartment... Twenty bucks says this guy’s like a hot banker."
JAKE,"I’ll take that action. Police, open up please."
OLD MAN,Hello?!
JAKE,"Hello, sir! My name is Detective Right-All-The-Time, and this is my partner, Detective Terribledetective."
AMY,We were wondering if you heard anything unusual last night? And are you single?
OLD MAN,Yes. But I’m also dying.
HOLT,"So Gina: in my experience, civilian administrators such as yourself often have their ear to the ground. What do Santiago and Peralta have riding on this bet of theirs?"
GINA,"I’ll tell you, on six conditions. Number One: you let me use your office to practice m’ dance moves. Second--"
HOLT,"How about this: if you tell me, I won’t have you suspended without pay."
GINA,"That sounds great. The bet is: if Amy gets more arrests, Jake has to give her his car. It’s an old Mustang, pretty sweet. If he gets more arrests, she has to go on a date with him."
HOLT,Just one date?
GINA,"He guarantees it’ll end in sex. She says it won’t. I don’t know, though, Jake’s got some moves. I’d bet on at least some over-the-clothes action."
HOLT,"That’s enough. Thank you, Gina."
GINA,I think you would get a real kick out of my jams.
HOLT,You cannot dance in my office.
GINA,Copy that.
CHARLES,"No surprises from the coroner. Two gunshots, shoulder and chest."
JAKE,"None of the neighbors heard or saw anything. And what’s worse, Santiago struck out with a 90 year-old. Hard. It was embarrassing."
HOLT,"All right. Hit the pawn shops. Canvas the neighborhood. And while you’re out, you can buy yourself a tie."
JAKE,"Oh, I’m wearing a tie right now. Check it out: Secret tie!"
HOLT,"First of all, you’re kind of over-doing it on the man-scaping. But more importantly, why do you refuse to take my orders seriously, Detective?"
JAKE,"Because, sir, if you’re wound too tight, you end up like Terry."
TERRY,Daddy’s gonna be home soon. I love you. I just love you so much.
JAKE,Crying at your desk and playing with sock puppets.
HOLT,"There’s a middle ground, Detective. Does anyone here know why it’s important to me that you dress appropriately? And it has nothing to do with the Patrol Guide."
ROSA,Guys look good in ties.
CHARLES,"Yes, they do! I’m wearing one right now!"
AMY,Show respect for the job. Pride. Confidence? Happiness.
JAKE,Are we just naming positive things? Rainbows. Kittens. Thanksgiving dinner!
HOLT,Hmm. Four highly-trained detectives and not one of you can solve this simple mystery. I want to be briefed on any new angles. Any questions?
JAKE,"Well, I was curious whether you thought I was doing too much man-scaping, and apparently you do, so I’m good."
JAKE,"Hey, what about that expensive jamon iber-crap stuff? The perp left a really expensive TV behind, but stole ham? Is there a place near the crime scene that sells it?"
CHARLES,"Beneficio’s might. Their cured meats section is ridiculous. Though, I mainly think of it as a gelato place--"
JAKE,Stop talking. Let’s go.
CHARLES,You gotta brief the C.O. first.
JAKE,We’ll brief him after we catch the guy.
RATKO,"My name is Ratko, I don’t know anything."
JAKE,"Okay, Ratko. Just a few questions. Do you recognize him? Henry Morgenthau?"
RATKO,No.
JAKE,"Look at the picture first, maybe, Ratko."
RATKO,I tell you. I don’t know him. I don’t know what happened. No more questions!
JAKE,"Okay, I’ll tell you what happened. He came by and said he had some hams to sell. You knew they were worth a lot of money, so you tried to rob him when he wasn’t home. Only he was home, and he fought back, so you shot him. Am I close? Nod your giant caveman head and drool if I’m close."
JAKE,"Oh man, I hate running! Ratko stop! Stop Ratko!"
JAKE,"Ow! Ratko, I’m getting mad."
CHARLES,That’s thirty dollar marmalade!
RATKO,I not mean to kill. It not my fault.
JAKE,Okay. Okay. I believe you. Be cool.
CHARLES,It really is the best gelato in the city.
TERRY,What the hell happened? And what’s on your face?
CHARLES,Passion fruit sorbet.
JAKE,"Good news is: we found the murderer. Ratko Slovic, a Serbian butcher. Robbery gone bad. He confessed and everything."
HOLT,"I don’t see a Serbian butcher in here, so I assume there’s bad news."
JAKE,"Charles and I may have allowed Ratko to escape. But, one more piece of good news:"
JAKE,(sing-songy) I got you some hazelnut! 
JAKE,"He’s seriously assigning me to the records room? Why do we even have a records room? The computer has been invented, right?"
TERRY,"You’re lucky, man. I wish I could get assigned here full time. You could not be farther from the action."
JAKE,"Sergeant, you know me. I have more arrests than anyone. Can you please tell the captain how dumb it is to lock his best detective in a file cabinet?"
AMY,Second best.
TERRY,"You’re wrong about Holt. That man has forgotten more about being a cop than you’ll ever know. In 1981, he caught the Disco Strangler."
HOLT,"It’s over, Disco Man. Put down the yo-yo and back away from the girl."
TERRY,He’s the real deal. You should listen to him.
AMY,"It’s gonna be hard to win our bet when you’re on the bench, Peralta. Although, I did start a new category --"
AMY,Look at that! You’re winning!
JAKE,Slam! That was a slam! Pretend that slammed.
ROSA,So? What movie did you get tickets to?
CHARLES,"Well, just to be safe, I bought tickets to all of them."
ROSA,“Just to be safe?” What does that mean?
CHARLES,"I don’t know. I didn’t want to mess up, because you’re sort of... opinionated."
ROSA,"You think I’m opinionated? Okay, here’s an opinion for you: you’re a bad judge of character and your shirt looks like vomit."
CHARLES,...So we could see North by Northwest--
ROSA,We are not seeing a movie together.
CHARLES,Sounds good.
HOLT,"So, you found something? I like the tie."
JAKE,"I was skeptical, but it really did make a difference in my work. I think I found something interesting in these files. Here, let me show you."
HOLT,I’m glad you’ve made progress in the case. Let’s have you brief the team. Holt grabs Jake’s pants and heads towards the bullpen.
JAKE,...That’s not necessary.
JAKE,"Yes. Well. Thank you all for coming. Including -- oh! -- Craig, our crime scene photographer. "
JAKE,"Great. So. After being unfairly tossed into the records room for no reason, I got so bored I started reading some old cases."
HOLT,A novel idea. 
JAKE,"“Ratko” was a made-up name, but: after looking through a million files, one of which I literally found in a spiderweb, I found a bunch of references to a Serbian thug, street names: “The Rat” and “The Butcher.” Suspect in a few break-ins -- used to hang out at a storage unit near Boerum Park...which has red soil, hence the muddy red footprints on Monganthau’s counter. Also, I am freezing. Can I put my pants on now? "
HOLT,"Fine work, Detective. Let’s give Peralta a hand, everyone. "
JAKE,Thank you. Thanks. That’s nice.
AMY,No record of Ratko on their ledger. Must have used cash.
HOLT,Maybe we’ll get lucky and he’ll turn up.
JAKE,"Well, I for one am very excited to be on a stakeout with you, Captain. You know what my fave part of stakeouts is? Patrol guide says: casual dress."
HOLT,Does he always talk this much?
AMY,I just tune it out. It’s like a white noise machine.
JAKE,"First off, that’s racist. Second of all, you caught the Disco Strangler, right? That dude wrapped a lot of yo-yos around a lot of hookers’ necks. Nice collar. But the thing I can’t understand is: young superstar detective takes down a serial killer... why’d it take you so long to get your first command?"
HOLT,Because I’m gay.
JAKE,...Seriously?
HOLT,I’m surprised you didn’t know. I don’t try to hide it.
JAKE,Damn. I am not a good detective.
ROSA,Hey. I feel bad that you spent all that money on movie tickets. Take this.
CHARLES,Why don’t you just come to the movies?
ROSA,No thanks.
CHARLES,...Okay. Well. This is awkward.
ROSA,It’s not awkward. I like your company. You’re sweet.
JAKE,"Captain, when I had my pants off, in no way was I... I didn’t know about your gay... gayness."
HOLT,"I know, Peralta. You’re a lot of things, but you’re not a homophobe."
AMY,When did you come out?
HOLT,"About twenty-five years ago. The NYPD was not ready for an openly gay detective. Then the old guard died, and suddenly, they couldn’t wait to show off the fact that they had a high-ranking gay officer. I made captain, but they put me into a public affairs unit. I was a good soldier, helped recruitment... but all I ever wanted was a command. Now, I finally got one, and I’m not going to screw it up."
JAKE,I feel dumb.
AMY,"My God. I have to thank you, Captain, because at this moment, Peralta is feeling humility, for maybe the first time in his life. Aren’t you, JP?"
JAKE,"Frankly, yes, I am, and Captain, I’m sorry. But also, look, there’s Ratko. Humility over. I’m amazing."
HOLT,Go.
AMY,He couldn’t lock himself in. Split up and find the ones that are unlocked.
HOLT,Looks like we all got door duty.
JAKE,I see what you did there. Nice.
PARROT,I’m lonely.
JAKE,"Hang in there, buddy."
JAKE,"Hello, Ratko."
RATKO,You can’t stop me. I’m going.
JAKE,"You’re not going, actually. Because if you’ll just take a quick peek to your right, you’ll see Detectives Boyle and Diaz."
JAKE,"Over there is Detective Santiago. And behind you is Captain Holt. Can you believe that? A captain, on a stakeout! He’s kind of a hands-on dude. Point is, we have you surrounded -- -- oh my God, I figured out the tie thing! Captain -- hey, I figured it out!"
HOLT,"Maybe now’s not the best time, Detective."
JAKE,"It’s a uniform. We’re a team, and ties are part of the uniform for that team. Right."
RATKO,...You ask Ratko what team?
JAKE,"No, Ratko, shut up. It’s important to you because you were kept off that team, and now you’re the coach and you want us all to wear the same uniform. Boom. I nailed it."
HOLT,"Yes, you did. Now, please arrest Ratko."
JAKE,"Oh -- right. Cool. Okay, Ratko, gun down. Get on the ground and put your hands on your --"
JAKE,Ugh. I hate running.
AMY,Got him.
JAKE,"That’s how we do things in the nine-nine, Captain. We catch bad guys, and we look good doing it."
HOLT,What’s wrong with you?
JAKE,"Never took off the speedo. Huge mistake. It is inside me. Great job, team!"
HOLT,"And what’s this all about, Detective?"
JAKE,"Oh, the tux? I’m done with work. This is how I dress in my free time."
HOLT,"You did well today, Peralta. But you’re going to need a little more humility if you’re going to make captain one day."
AMY,"Him?! If anyone’s going to make captain in this bar, it’s me. And you, Captain, because you are a captain."
JAKE,"Yeah, I don’t want your job. That’s the last thing I want."
HOLT,Okay. Guess I was mistaken. The beers are on him.
GINA,How’d it go with Rosa?
CHARLES,"We will not be seeing a movie. But -- and this is big -- she called me “sweet.” Sweet’s pretty good, right?"
GINA,Sweet’s not good. Grow a pair.
JAKE,"Gotta give it up, Santiago took him down hard. Well done. (off her smile) It was sexy. I was very into it."
AMY,"Ugh, just when you’re being sincere, you ruin everything."
JAKE,"Yeah, that’s kind of my move."
TERRY,Hoo boy. So glad I was not there.
HOLT,I think you would’ve handled yourself just fine.
HOLT,"Every cop is different. Every precinct is different. But this is the nine-nine. You want to be on this team? You grind it. Get cases, work cases, solve cases. The right way. To the detectives of the nine-nine."
JAKE,"And to Captain Holt...’s best detective, Jake Peralta."
